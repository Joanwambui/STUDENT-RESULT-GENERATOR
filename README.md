# STUDENT-RESULT-GENERATOR
The query calculates students' average marks and their result classifications (e.g., "First Class", "Fail") based on their marks and predefined pass marks for each subject. It utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize and join student data, dynamically retrieve subject information, and aggregate results efficiently.
